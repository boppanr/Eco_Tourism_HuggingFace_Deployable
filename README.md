# Review Genie — Eco Tourism (Auto-generated HF Space)

This repository was auto-generated from the uploaded `Eco_Tourism.ipynb` notebook.

## Contents
- `Eco_Tourism.ipynb` — original notebook you uploaded.
- `pipeline.py` — concatenated code cells turned into functions with deterministic seed setup.
- `app.py` — Gradio demo wrapper that runs `pipeline.py`.
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies (cleaned and corrected).
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to deploy to Hugging Face Spaces
1. Create a new Space (Gradio) on Hugging Face.
2. Upload all files from this zip.
3. The Space will detect this config and launch automatically.
4. For deterministic results, set environment variable `REVIEW_GENIE_SEED` (default 42).
